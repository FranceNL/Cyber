1. Protect Privileged Accounts üõ°Ô∏è
This is your top priority because attackers will immediately try to compromise accounts with the highest privileges.

Change Passwords: Immediately reset the passwords for the Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and Schema Admins groups. Use long, complex passphrases (20+ characters) and do not reuse them. This is a critical step to invalidate any credentials that may have already been stolen.

Limit Admin Logons: In Group Policy, restrict privileged accounts from logging on to ordinary user workstations or servers. This helps contain the blast radius of a credential theft attack, as an attacker can't use a stolen privileged credential on a compromised host to move laterally.

Disable Unnecessary Accounts: Disable any service accounts or user accounts that are no longer in use, especially those that have administrative privileges.

2. Isolate Domain Controllers üîí
Domain Controllers (DCs) are the crown jewels of your network. Attackers will try to connect to them directly.

Review Firewall Rules: On each domain controller, verify and harden the Windows Firewall. Only allow necessary inbound traffic from other domain controllers, secure jump servers, and approved administrative workstations. Block all other inbound connections.

Restrict RDP Access: Limit Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to DCs to only the most trusted administrative accounts and jump servers. The fewer systems that can connect, the smaller the attack surface.

3. Harden Authentication and Protocols üîë
Many common attacks, such as pass-the-hash and Kerberoasting, exploit weak or legacy authentication protocols.

Disable Legacy Protocols: If possible, disable Server Message Block (SMBv1) and older versions of the New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM). These are known to be vulnerable to credential relay and brute-force attacks.

Enable LDAP Signing: Configure the domain controllers to require LDAP signing. This protects against man-in-the-middle attacks that could be used to intercept and alter LDAP communications.

4. Implement Quick Wins with Group Policy üìù
Use Group Policy to enforce security settings across the domain quickly. Focus on settings that have an immediate effect.

Account Lockout Policy: Configure a strict account lockout policy. Set a low threshold for failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts) to prevent brute-force attacks on user accounts, particularly those with administrative privileges.

Strong Password Policy: Reinforce your default domain password policy to require longer, more complex passwords (if you can't implement Fine-Grained Password Policies in time).

Kerberos Pre-authentication: Ensure that Kerberos pre-authentication is enabled for all user accounts to prevent AS-REP roasting attacks, where an attacker can request a Kerberos ticket for a user without a pre-authentication step.

5. Start Monitoring and Logging üïµÔ∏è
Even with the best preventative measures, you need to be able to detect an attack in progress.

Enable Advanced Auditing: Enable advanced audit policies for critical actions. At a minimum, focus on "Logon/Logoff" and "Account Management" events (e.g., failed logins, password changes, new account creations). These logs can provide early indicators of compromise.

Quick Scan for Anomalies: Do a quick check for common signs of a compromised Active Directory, such as:

New accounts or groups that shouldn't exist.

Unexpected changes in privileged group membership.

Services running under privileged accounts that shouldn't be.
