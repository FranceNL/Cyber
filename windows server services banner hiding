Hiding Banners for IIS
Internet Information Services (IIS) is a common target. You can hide the server banner through the IIS Manager, the Windows Registry, or by modifying the web.config file.

Using IIS Manager:
Open the IIS Manager on your server.
Navigate to your server name in the left-hand connections pane.
Double-click on the HTTP Response Headers feature in the middle pane.
Select the Server header and click Remove in the right-hand actions pane.
You can also remove the X-Powered-By header, which often reveals the ASP.NET version.

Using the Windows Registry:
Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters.
Create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value named DisableServerHeader.
Set the value to 1.
Restart the HTTP service using net stop http and net start http in an elevated command prompt or PowerShell.

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
The banner for FTP on a Windows Server is typically part of the IIS (Internet Information Services) FTP service.

Using IIS Manager:
Open IIS Manager.
Navigate to the specific FTP site.
In the main pane, double-click FTP Messages.
Check the box for Suppress default banner.
You can then enter a custom banner message if you want, or leave it blank to remove the banner entirely. This action modifies the response from "220 Microsoft FTP Service" to simply "220."
This is a straightforward change that significantly reduces the information leakage.

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
Hiding the SMTP banner is important because it often reveals the mail server software and its version (e.g., Microsoft Exchange, Postfix).

Using PowerShell (for Exchange): For modern Exchange servers, you can modify the banner using the Exchange Management Shell. The Set-ReceiveConnector cmdlet is used for this.
To change the banner, use the following command:
PowerShell
    Set-ReceiveConnector -Identity "YourReceiveConnectorName" -Banner "220 YourBannerText"
Note: The banner text must start with the SMTP response code 220. For example, 220 mail.yourdomain.com.
Other SMTP Servers: If you're using a different SMTP service, you'll need to consult its specific documentation. Most mail server applications have a configuration file or a dedicated management console setting to change or suppress the initial greeting.

SSH (Secure Shell)
The SSH banner is an important security point because it often includes the OpenSSH version, which can have known vulnerabilities. On Windows Server, you're likely using the built-in OpenSSH server.

Modify the Configuration File:
Go to the OpenSSH configuration directory, usually located at %ProgramData%\ssh.
Open the sshd_config file in a text editor like Notepad.
You can add or uncomment a Banner directive, but this simply displays a message in addition to the default banner.
To truly hide or change the version information, you would need to use a more advanced method, as it is a hardcoded part of the SSH protocol handshake. One method is to use a third-party tool or modify the binary itself, which is not recommended as it's an unsupported and potentially unstable change.
